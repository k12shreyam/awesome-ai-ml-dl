## Static analysis

### Focussed packages

* [mccabe](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe) - check McCabe complexity
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) - a static type checker that aims to combine the benefits of duck typing and static typing, frequently used with [MonkeyType](https://github.com/Instagram/MonkeyType)
* [py-find-injection](https://github.com/uber/py-find-injection) - find SQL injection vulnerabilities in Python code
* [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) - (formerly `pep8`) check Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8
* [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle) - check compliance with Python docstring conventions
* [pyflakes](https://github.com/pyflakes/pyflakes/) - check Python source files for errors
* [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) - looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells. It additionally includes `pyreverse` (an UML diagram generator) and `symilar` (a similarities checker).
* [pyre-check](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) - A fast, scalable type checker for large Python codebases
* [pyright](https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright) - Static type checker for Python, created to address gaps in existing tools like mypy.
* [pyroma](https://github.com/regebro/pyroma) - rate how well a Python project complies with the best practices of the Python packaging ecosystem, and list issues that could be improved
* [PyT - Python Taint](https://github.com/python-security/pyt) - A static analysis tool for detecting security vulnerabilities in Python web applications.
* [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype) - A static type analyzer for Python code.
* [Review of Python Static Analysis Tools](https://www.codacy.com/blog/review-of-python-static-analysis-tools/)
* [Python Static Analysis Tools ](https://luminousmen.com/post/python-static-analysis-tools)
* See [awesome-static-analysis for Python](https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis/blob/master/README.md#python)

### Python wrappers

* [ciocheck](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/ciocheck) - linter, formatter and test suite helper. As a linter, it is a wrapper around `pep8`, `pydocstyle`, `flake8`, and `pylint`.
* [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) - a wrapper around `pyflakes`, `pycodestyle` and `mccabe`
* [multilint](https://github.com/adamchainz/multilint) - a wrapper around `flake8`, `isort` and `modernize`
* [prospector](https://github.com/PyCQA/prospector) - a wrapper around `pylint`, `pep8`, `mccabe` and others
